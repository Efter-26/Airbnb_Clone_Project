## 📌 Overview
This project is a clone implementation inspired by **Airbnb**, designed to showcase modern web development practices.  
It includes features of the Airbnb home page such as **category-based hotel room view**, **searching & filtering**, and **language selection**.  

The goal of the project was to deepen understanding of **full-stack development**, covering both **frontend** and **backend** systems.  
- The **frontend** is built with Next.js (React) for a modern, responsive UI.  
- The **backend** (found in a separate repository) powers the application with REST APIs for hotel room data, search queries, authentication, and booking management.
